# 7. Library Book Management
# Goal: Maintain a catalog of books across multiple branches.
# Requirements:
# - Store each branchâ€™s book list as a set.
# - Use union() to find all available books.
# - Use intersection() to find common books.
# - Use difference() to find books only in one branch.
# Concepts Covered: All set operations.

print("Books in both branches:", common_books)
print("Books only in Branch A:", unique_to_a)
