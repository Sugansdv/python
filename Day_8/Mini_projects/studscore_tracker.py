# 2. Student Score Tracker
# Description: Maintain student names and marks using lists and nested lists.

# Use a nested list format: [['Ram', 85], ['Sam', 78]]

# Access and update specific studentâ€™s marks

# Add a new student

print("\nAdded new student: Vikram")

# Remove a student
students.remove(['Vishwa', 67])
print("Removed student: Priya")

# Display all students and their marks
print("\nAll Students:")
